# Hexagon Visualization

This project is a Python script for generating and visualizing clusters of hexagons. It uses **Matplotlib** and **NumPy** to create a central hexagon surrounded by additional hexagonal clusters.

## Features
- Draws a central hexagon.
- Adds a ring of 6 hexagons around the central one.
- Creates additional clusters of 7 hexagons (1 central + 6 surrounding).
- Alternates colors (green and yellow) for outer clusters.
- Simple, modular design for easy extension.
